Python Challenge

In this Python challenge we will use a program to help identify the density of an object and compare with the known density of different metals such as gold, silver, bronze, etc.
Our algorithm will:

Ask the user to enter the mass of an object. (in Kg)
Ask the user to enter the volume of an object. (in m3)
Calculate and output the density of this object (mass/volume)
Compare this density with the densities of different metals such as pure gold, silver and bronze and output the corresponding metal if there is a match.
Our algorithm will use the following data:

Metal	Density
Aluminium	Between 2400 kg/m3 and 2700 kg/m3
Bronze	Between 8100 kg/m3 and 8300 kg/m3
Silver	Between 10400 kg/m3 and 10600 kg/m3
Lead	Between 11200 kg/m3 and 11400 kg/m3
Gold	Between 17100 kg/m3 and 17500 kg/m3
Platinum	Between 21000 kg/m3 and 21500 kg/m3
